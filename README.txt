  Search by customer doesn't show any info about deliveryDate or things like that

1. A cover sheet with the name of the project, your names, education programs, and e-mail addresses. You must check mail to these addresses regularly.
Also give the date of submission and complete instructions for running your program.
2. An introduction (what the project is about, etc.).
3. Something about requirements that you fulfill or don’t fulfill.
4. An outline of your system (which database manager you use, which programs you have
written, how the programs communicate with the database, etc.).
5. An E/R diagram which describes the system.
6. Relations. Indicate primary keys, possibly secondary keys, and foreign keys. You must
show that the relations are normalized according to your chosen normal form (if a relation “obviously” is in BCNF you may say so, provided that you justify your statement). If a
relation is in a lower normal form than BCNF, you must justify this choice.
7. SQL statements to create all tables, views, stored procedures, and other database elements.
(Don’t include statements to create the initial contents of the database.)
8. A user’s manual (not necessary if everything in the program is self-explanatory).
